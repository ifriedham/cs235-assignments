 Now
 I
 know
 what
 youre
 thinking
 Oh
 no
 Thors
 in
 a
 cage
 How
 did
 this
 happen
 Well
 sometimes
 you
 have
 to
 get
 captured
 just
 to
 get
 a
 straight
 answer
 out
 of
 somebody
 Its
 a
 long
 story
 but
 basically
 Im
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 hero
 See
 I
 spent
 some
 time
 on
 Earth
 Fought
 some
 robots
 saved
 the
 planet
 a
 couple
 of
 times
 Then
 I
 went
 searching
 through
 the
 cosmos
 for
 some
 magic
 colorful
 Infinity
 Stone
 things
 Didnt
 find
 any
 Thats
 when
 I
 came
 across
 a
 path
 of
 death
 and
 destruction
 which
 led
 me
 all
 the
 way
 here
 into
 this
 cage
 where
 I
 met
 you
 How
 much
 longer
 do
 you
 think
 well
 be
 here
 Thor
 son
 of
 Odin
 Surtur
 son
 of
 a
 bitch
 Youre
 still
 alive
 I
 thought
 my
 father
 killed
 you
 a
 half
 a
 million
 years
 ago
 I
 cannot
 die
 Not
 until
 I
 fulfill
 my
 destiny
 and
 lay
 waste
 to
 your
 home
 Its
 funny
 you
 should
 mention
 that
 Because
 Ive
 been
 having
 these
 terrible
 dreams
 of
 late
 Asgard
 up
 in
 flames
 falling
 to
 ruins
 And
 you
 Surtur
 are
 at
 the
 center
 of
 all
 of
 them
 Then
 you
 have
 seen
 Ragnarok
 the
 fall
 of
 Asgard
 
 The
 great
 prophecy
 
 Hang
 on
 Hang
 on
 Ill
 be
 back
 around
 shortly
 I
 really
 feel
 like
 we
 were
 connecting
 there
 Okay
 so
 Ragnarok
 Tell
 me
 about
 that
 Walk
 me
 through
 it
 My
 time
 has
 come
 When
 my
 crown
 is
 reunited
 with
 the
 Eternal
 Flame
 I
 shall
 be
 restored
 to
 my
 full
 might
 I
 will
 tower
 over
 the
 mountains
 and
 bury
 my
 sword
 deep
 in
 Asgards
 Hang
 on
 Give
 it
 a
 second
 I
 swear
 Im
 not
 even
 moving
 Its
 just
 doing
 this
 on
 its
 own
 Im
 really
 sorry
 Okay
 so
 let
 me
 get
 this
 straight
 Youre
 going
 to
 put
 your
 crown
 into
 the
 Eternal
 Flame
 and
 then
 youll
 suddenly
 grow
 as
 big
 as
 a
 house
 A
 mountain
 The
 Eternal
 Flame
 that
 Odin
 keeps
 locked
 away
 on
 Asgard
 Odin
 is
 not
 on
 Asgard
 And
 your
 absence
 has
 left
 the
 throne
 defenseless
 Okay
 so
 where
 is
 it
 This
 crown
 This
 is
 my
 crown
 the
 source
 of
 my
 power
 Oh
 thats
 a
 crown
 I
 thought
 it
 was
 a
 big
 eyebrow
 Its
 a
 crown
 Anyway
 it
 sounds
 like
 all
 I
 have
 to
 do
 to
 stop
 Ragnarok
 is
 rip
 that
 thing
 off
 your
 head
 But
 Ragnarok
 has
 already
 begun
 You
 cannot
 stop
 it
 I
 am
 Asgards
 doom
 and
 so
 are
 you
 All
 will
 suffer
 all
 will
 burn
 Thats
 intense
 To
 be
 honest
 seeing
 you
 grow
 really
 big
 and
 set
 fire
 to
 a
 planet
 would
 be
 quite
 the
 spectacle
 But
 it
 looks
 like
 Im
 gonna
 have
 to
 choose
 option
 B
 where
 I
 bust
 out
 of
 these
 chains
 knock
 that
 tiara
 off
 your
 head
 and
 stash
 it
 away
 in
 Asgards
 vault
 You
 cannot
 stop
 Ragnarok
 Why
 fight
 it
 Because
 thats
 what
 heroes
 do
 Wait
 Im
 sorry
 I
 didnt
 time
 that
 right
 And
 now
 You
 have
 made
 a
 grave
 mistake
 Odinson
 I
 make
 grave
 mistakes
 all
 the
 time
 Everything
 seems
 to
 work
 out
 Heimdall
 I
 know
 its
 been
 a
 while
 but
 I
 could
 really
 use
 a
 fast
 exit
 Heimdall
 Heimdall
 was
 an
 idiot
 This
 job
 should
 have
 made
 him
 rich
 Now
 the
 job
 aint
 easy
 but
 it
 does
 have
 its
 benefits
 The
 Bifrost
 gives
 me
 access
 to
 everything
 the
 Nine
 Realms
 has
 to
 offer
 I
 mean
 its
 all
 mine
 for
 the
 taking
 Behold
 My
 stuff
 Im
 particularly
 fond
 of
 these
 I
 pulled
 them
 out
 of
 a
 place
 on
 Midgard
 called
 Texas
 I
 even
 named
 them
 Des
 and
 Troy
 You
 see
 when
 you
 put
 them
 together
 they
 destroy
 Heimdall
 come
 on
 Stay
 Heimdall
 Im
 running
 short
 on
 options
 Heimdall
 Skurge
 Is
 that
 important
 You
 girls
 are
 in
 for
 a
 treat
 Girls
 Well
 well
 well
 Look
 who
 decided
 to
 pop
 in
 Thanks
 for
 scaring
 away
 my
 company
 and
 drenching
 my
 workplace
 in
 brains
 Who
 are
 you
 Dont
 you
 remember
 Im
 Skurge
 We
 fought
 together
 on
 Vanaheim
 Right
 Where
 is
 Heimdall
 That
 traitor
 No
 one
 knows
 Hes
 a
 fugitive
 of
 the
 throne
 Traitor
 Yeah
 You
 see
 Odin
 charged
 Heimdall
 with
 negligence
 of
 duty
 but
 he
 disappeared
 before
 the
 trial
 Hard
 to
 catch
 a
 guy
 who
 can
 see
 everything
 in
 the
 universe
 Sure
 Hold
 on
 Im
 supposed
 to
 announce
 your
 arrival
 What
 the
 hell
 is
 that
 Oh
 brother
 This
 is
 it
 I
 take
 my
 leave
 You
 fool
 you
 didnt
 listen
 Im
 sorry
 Lady
 Sif
 get
 help
 Somebody
 help
 Sorry
 for
 all
 Ive
 done
 Its
 all
 right
 Hold
 on
 Im
 sorry
 I
 tried
 to
 rule
 Earth
 Theyd
 be
 lucky
 to
 have
 you
 Im
 sorry
 about
 that
 thing
 with
 the
 Tesseract
 
 I
 just
 couldnt
 help
 myself
 
 I
 know
 Im
 a
 trickster
 So
 mischievous
 Sorry
 about
 that
 time
 I
 turned
 you
 into
 a
 frog
 It
 was
 a
 wonderful
 joke
 Twas
 indeed
 hilarious
 You
 are
 the
 savior
 of
 Asgard
 
 Tell
 my
 story
 
 I
 will
 Build
 a
 statue
 for
 me
 We
 will
 build
 a
 big
 statue
 for
 you
 With
 my
 helmet
 on
 with
 the
 big
 bendy
 horns
 I
 will
 tell
 Father
 what
 you
 did
 here
 today
 I
 didnt
 do
 it
 for
 him
 I
 didnt
 do
 it
 for
 him
 No
 And
 so
 Loki
 died
 of
 his
 wounds
 giving
 his
 life
 for
 ours
 He
 fought
 back
 those
 disgusting
 elves
 he
 brought
 peace
 to
 the
 realm
 Loki
 my
 boy
 Twas
 many
 moons
 ago
 I
 found
 you
 on
 that
 frostbitten
 battlefield
 On
 that
 day
 I
 did
 not
 yet
 see
 in
 you
 Asgards
 savior
 No
 You
 were
 merely
 a
 little
 blue
 baby
 icicle
 that
 melted
 this
 old
 fools
 heart
 Bravo
 Bravo
 Well
 done
 Bravo
 Father
 Shit
 My
 son
 Thor
 has
 returned
 Greetings
 my
 boy
 Its
 an
 interesting
 play
 Whats
 it
 called
 The
 Tragedy
 of
 Loki
 of
 Asgard
 The
 people
 wanted
 to
 commemorate
 him
 Indeed
 they
 should
 I
 like
 the
 statue
 A
 lot
 better
 looking
 than
 he
 was
 when
 he
 was
 alive
 though
 A
 little
 less
 weaselly
 less
 greasy
 maybe
 Do
 you
 know
 what
 this
 is
 The
 skull
 of
 Surtur
 Thats
 a
 formidable
 weapon
 Do
 me
 a
 favor
 Lock
 this
 away
 in
 a
 vault
 so
 it
 doesnt
 turn
 into
 a
 giant
 monster
 and
 destroy
 the
 whole
 planet
 Thank
 you
 dear
 So
 its
 back
 to
 Midgard
 for
 you
 is
 it
 Nope
 Ive
 been
 having
 this
 reoccurring
 dream
 lately
 Every
 night
 I
 see
 Asgard
 fall
 into
 ruins
 Thats
 just
 a
 silly
 dream
 signs
 of
 an
 overactive
 imagination
 Possibly
 But
 then
 I
 decide
 to
 go
 out
 there
 and
 investigate
 And
 what
 do
 I
 find
 but
 the
 Nine
 Realms
 completely
 in
 chaos
 Enemies
 of
 Asgard
 assembling
 plotting
 our
 demise
 all
 while
 you
 Odin
 the
 protector
 of
 those
 Nine
 Realms
 are
 sitting
 here
 in
 your
 bathrobe
 eating
 grapes
 Yes
 it
 is
 best
 to
 respect
 our
 neighbors
 freedom
 Yes
 of
 course
 the
 freedom
 to
 be
 massacred
 Yes
 besides
 Ive
 been
 rather
 busy
 myself
 Watching
 theater
 Board
 meetings
 and
 security
 council
 meetings
 
 Youre
 really
 gonna
 make
 me
 do
 it
 
 Do
 what
 You
 know
 that
 nothing
 will
 stop
 Mjolnir
 as
 it
 returns
 to
 my
 hand
 Not
 even
 your
 face
 Youve
 gone
 quite
 mad
 Youll
 be
 executed
 for
 this
 Then
 Ill
 see
 you
 on
 the
 other
 side
 brother
 All
 right
 I
 yield
 Behold
 Thor
 
 Odinson
 
 No
 You
 had
 one
 job
 Just
 the
 one
 Wheres
 Odin
 You
 just
 couldnt
 stay
 away
 could
 you
 Everything
 was
 fine
 without
 you
 Asgard
 was
 prospering
 Youve
 ruined
 everything
 
 Ask
 them
 
 Wheres
 Father
 Did
 you
 kill
 him
 You
 had
 what
 you
 wanted
 You
 had
 the
 independence
 you
 asked
 for
 Okay
 I
 know
 exactly
 where
 he
 is
 I
 swear
 I
 left
 him
 right
 here
 Right
 here
 on
 the
 sidewalk
 or
 right
 there
 where
 the
 building
 is
 being
 demolished
 Great
 planning
 How
 was
 I
 supposed
 to
 know
 Cant
 see
 into
 the
 future
 Im
 not
 a
 witch
 No
 Then
 why
 do
 you
 dress
 like
 one
 
 Hey
 
 I
 cant
 believe
 youre
 alive
 I
 saw
 you
 die
 I
 mourned
 you
 I
 cried
 for
 you
 Im
 honored
 Ask
 him
 Hi
 Would
 you
 mind
 taking
 a
 picture
 with
 us
 Sure
 Start
 figuring
 out
 where
 he
 is
 Oh
 my
 God
 Sorry
 to
 hear
 that
 Jane
 dumped
 you
 She
 didnt
 dump
 me
 you
 know
 I
 dumped
 her
 It
 was
 a
 mutual
 dumping
 Whats
 this
 What
 are
 you
 doing
 This
 isnt
 me
 Loki
 Thor
 Odinson
 God
 of
 Thunder
 You
 can
 put
 down
 the
 umbrella
 So
 Earth
 has
 wizards
 now
 The
 preferred
 term
 is
 Master
 of
 the
 Mystic
 Arts
 You
 can
 leave
 that
 now
 All
 right
 wizard
 Who
 are
 you
 Why
 should
 I
 care
 My
 name
 is
 Doctor
 Stephen
 Strange
 and
 I
 have
 some
 questions
 for
 you
 Take
 a
 seat
 Tea
 I
 dont
 drink
 tea
 What
 do
 you
 drink
 Not
 tea
 So
 I
 keep
 a
 watch
 list
 of
 individuals
 and
 beings
 from
 other
 realms
 that
 may
 be
 a
 threat
 to
 this
 world
 Your
 adopted
 brother
 Loki
 is
 one
 of
 those
 beings
 Hes
 a
 worthy
 inclusion
 Then
 why
 bring
 him
 here
 Were
 looking
 for
 my
 father
 So
 if
 I
 were
 to
 tell
 you
 where
 Odin
 was
 all
 parties
 concerned
 would
 promptly
 return
 to
 Asgard
 Promptly
 Great
 Then
 Ill
 help
 you
 If
 you
 knew
 where
 he
 was
 why
 didnt
 you
 call
 me
 I
 have
 to
 tell
 you
 he
 was
 adamant
 that
 he
 not
 be
 disturbed
 Your
 father
 said
 he
 had
 chosen
 to
 remain
 in
 exile
 And
 you
 dont
 have
 a
 phone
 No
 I
 dont
 have
 a
 phone
 but
 you
 could
 have
 sent
 an
 electronic
 letter
 Its
 called
 an
 email
 
 Yeah
 do
 you
 have
 a
 computer
 
 No
 What
 for
 Anyway
 my
 father
 is
 no
 longer
 in
 exile
 So
 if
 you
 could
 tell
 me
 where
 he
 is
 I
 can
 take
 him
 home
 Gladly
 Hes
 in
 Norway
 Im
 just
 seeing
 whether
 this
 incantation
 requires
 any
 Asgardian
 modifications
 Nope
 We
 dont
 need
 that
 Will
 you
 stop
 doing
 that
 I
 need
 just
 one
 strand
 of
 your
 hair
 Let
 me
 explain
 something
 My
 hair
 is
 not
 to
 be
 meddled
 with
 We
 could
 have
 just
 walked
 Hes
 waiting
 for
 you
 All
 right
 Dont
 forget
 your
 umbrella
 Yes
 Sorry
 There
 we
 go
 I
 suppose
 Ill
 need
 my
 brother
 back
 Yeah
 Right
 I
 have
 been
 falling
 for
 
 minutes
 You
 can
 handle
 him
 from
 here
 Yes
 Of
 course
 Thank
 you
 very
 much
 for
 your
 help
 Good
 luck
 Handle
 me
 Who
 are
 you
 Loki
 You
 think
 youre
 some
 kind
 of
 sorcerer
 Dont
 think
 for
 one
 minute

 secondrate
 Byebye
 Father
 Look

 this
 place
 Its
 beautiful
 Father
 its

 My
 sons
 Ive
 been
 waiting
 for
 you
 I
 know
 Weve
 come
 to
 take
 you
 home
 Home
 yes
 Your
 mother
 she
 calls
 me
 Do
 you
 hear
 it
 Loki
 lift
 your
 magic
 Took
 me
 quite
 a
 while
 to
 break
 free
 from
 your
 spell
 Frigga
 would
 have
 been
 proud
 Come
 and
 sit
 with
 me
 I
 dont
 have
 much
 time
 I
 know
 we
 failed
 you
 But
 we
 can
 make
 this
 right
 I
 failed
 you
 It
 is
 upon
 us
 Ragnarok
 No
 Ive
 stopped
 Ragnarok
 I
 put
 an
 end
 to
 Surtur
 No
 It
 has
 already
 begun
 Shes
 coming
 My
 life
 was
 all
 that
 held
 her
 back
 But
 my
 time
 has
 come
 I
 cannot
 keep
 her
 away
 any
 longer
 Father
 who
 are
 you
 talking
 about
 Goddess
 of
 Death
 Hela
 My
 firstborn
 Your
 sister
 Your
 what
 Her
 violent
 appetites
 grew
 beyond
 my
 control
 I
 couldnt
 stop
 her
 so
 I
 imprisoned
 her
 Locked
 her
 away
 She
 draws
 her
 strength
 from
 Asgard
 and
 once
 she
 gets
 there
 her
 powers
 will
 be
 limitless
 Whatever
 she
 is
 we
 can
 stop
 her
 together
 We
 can
 face
 her
 together
 No
 we
 wont
 Im
 on
 a
 different
 path
 now
 This
 you
 must
 face
 alone
 I
 love
 you
 my
 sons
 Look
 at
 that
 Remember
 this
 place
 Home
 Brother
 This
 was
 your
 doing
 So
 hes
 gone
 Thats
 a
 shame
 I
 wouldve
 liked
 to
 have
 seen
 that
 You
 must
 be
 Hela
 Im
 Thor
 son
 of
 Odin
 Really
 You
 dont
 look
 like
 him
 Perhaps
 we
 can
 come
 to
 an
 arrangement
 You
 sound
 like
 him
 Kneel
 Beg
 your
 pardon
 Kneel
 Before
 your
 queen
 I
 dont
 think
 so
 Its
 not
 possible
 Darling
 you
 have
 no
 idea
 whats
 possible
 Bring
 us
 back
 No
 Loki
 Who
 are
 you
 What
 have
 you
 done
 with
 Thor
 Im
 Hela
 Im
 just
 a
 janitor
 You
 look
 like
 a
 smart
 boy
 with
 good
 survival
 instincts
 How
 would
 you
 like
 a
 job
 Are
 you
 a
 fighter
 Or
 are
 you
 food
 Im
 just
 passing
 through
 It
 is
 food
 On
 your
 knees
 Hes
 mine
 Wait
 Wait
 Hes
 mine
 So
 if
 you
 want
 him
 you
 go
 through
 me
 But
 weve
 already
 got
 him
 All
 right
 then
 I
 guess
 I
 go
 through
 you
 More
 food
 Thank
 you
 Scrapper
 
 I
 need
 clearance
 and
 an
 audience
 with
 the
 boss
 Ive
 got
 something
 special
 Hey
 Where
 are
 you
 taking
 me
 Answer
 me
 Hey
 I
 am
 Thor
 son
 of
 Odin
 I
 need
 to
 get
 back
 to
 Asgard
 Many
 apologies
 your
 majesty
 Its
 come
 to
 my
 attention
 that
 you
 dont
 know
 who
 I
 am
 I
 am
 Hela
 Odins
 firstborn
 the
 commander
 of
 the
 Legions
 of
 Asgard
 the
 rightful
 heir
 to
 the
 throne
 and
 the
 Goddess
 of
 Death
 My
 father
 is
 dead
 As
 are
 the
 princes
 Youre
 welcome
 We
 were
 once
 the
 seat
 of
 absolute
 power
 in
 the
 cosmos
 Our
 supremacy
 was
 unchallenged
 Yet
 Odin
 stopped
 at
 Nine
 Realms
 Our
 destiny
 is
 to
 rule
 over
 all
 others
 And
 I
 am
 here
 to
 restore
 that
 power
 Kneel
 before
 me
 and
 rise
 into
 the
 ranks
 of
 my
 great
 conquest
 Whoever
 you
 are
 whatever
 youve
 done
 surrender
 now
 Or
 we
 will
 show
 you
 no
 mercy
 Whoever
 I
 am
 Did
 you
 listen
 to
 a
 word
 I
 said
 This
 is
 your
 last
 warning
 I
 thought
 youd
 be
 happy
 to
 see
 me
 Fine
 Charge
 Ive
 missed
 this
 Still
 its
 a
 shame
 Good
 soldiers
 dying
 for
 nothing
 all
 because
 they
 couldnt
 see
 the
 future
 Sad
 Look
 still
 alive
 Change
 of
 heart
 Go
 back
 to
 whatever
 cave
 you
 crept
 out
 of
 You
 evil
 demoness
 Lets
 go
 see
 my
 palace
 Fear
 not
 for
 you
 are
 found
 You
 are
 home
 and
 there
 is
 no
 going
 back
 No
 one
 leaves
 this
 place
 But
 what
 is
 this
 place
 The
 answer
 is
 Sakaar
 Surrounded
 by
 cosmic
 gateways
 Sakaar
 lives
 on
 the
 edge
 of
 the
 known
 and
 unknown
 It
 is
 the
 collection
 point
 for
 all
 lost
 and
 unloved
 things
 Like
 you
 But
 here
 on
 Sakaar
 you
 are
 significant
 You
 are
 valuable
 Here
 you
 are
 loved
 What
 the
 hell
 And
 no
 one
 loves
 you
 more
 than
 the
 Grandmaster
 He
 is
 the
 original
 the
 first
 lost
 and
 the
 first
 found
 The
 creator
 of
 Sakaar
 and
 father
 of
 the
 Contest
 of
 Champions
 Where
 once
 you
 were
 nothing
 now

 are
 something
 You

 Grandmaster

 manners

 introduced
 myself
 Come

 Follow

 My
 name
 is
 Grandmaster
 I
 preside
 over
 a
 little
 harlequinade
 called
 the
 Contest
 of
 Champions
 People
 come
 from
 far
 and
 wide
 to
 unwillingly
 participate
 in
 it
 And
 you
 my
 friend
 might
 just
 be
 part
 of
 the
 new
 cast
 What
 do
 you
 say
 to
 that
 Were
 not
 friends
 and
 I
 dont
 give
 a
 shit
 about
 your
 games
 Im
 going
 back
 to
 Asgard
 Assgard
 One
 two
 three
 four
 There
 was
 a
 wormhole
 in
 space
 and
 time
 beneath
 me
 At
 that
 moment
 I
 let
 go
 Loki
 Loki
 Loki
 Over
 here
 Over
 here
 
 Excuse

 second
 
 Loki

 stupid
 chair
 
 Wheres

 chair
 
 Get

 of
 this
 one
 Get

 I
 cant
 
 What
 Ive
 made
 friends
 with
 this
 man
 Hes
 called
 the
 Grandmaster
 
 Hes
 crazy
 
 Ive
 gained
 his
 favor
 The
 Bifrost
 brought
 me
 out
 here
 weeks
 ago
 
 Weeks
 ago
 
 Yes
 I
 just
 got
 here
 What
 are
 you
 whispering
 about
 Time
 works
 real
 different
 around
 these
 parts
 On
 any
 other
 world
 Id
 be
 like
 millions
 of
 years
 old
 But
 here
 on
 Sakaar
 In
 any
 case
 you
 know
 this
 You
 call
 yourself
 Lord
 of
 Thunder
 God
 of
 Thunder
 Tell
 him
 Ive
 never
 met
 this
 man
 in
 my
 life
 
 Hes
 my
 brother
 
 Adopted
 Is
 he
 any
 kind
 of
 a
 fighter
 You
 take
 this
 thing
 out
 of
 my
 neck
 and
 Ill
 show
 you
 Now
 listen
 to
 that
 Hes
 threatening
 me
 Hey
 Sparkles
 heres
 the
 deal
 If
 you
 wanna
 get
 back
 to
 Assplace
 Assberg
 Asgard
 Any
 contender
 who
 defeats
 my
 champion
 their
 freedom
 they
 shall
 win
 Fine
 Then
 point
 me
 in
 the
 direction
 of
 whoevers
 ass
 I
 have
 to
 kick
 Thats
 what
 I
 call
 contender
 Direction
 would
 be
 this
 way
 Lord
 Loki
 Hey
 Take
 it
 easy
 man
 Over
 here
 The
 pile
 of
 rocks
 waving
 at
 you
 Here
 Yeah
 Im
 actually
 a
 thing
 Im
 a
 being
 Allow
 me
 to
 introduce
 myself
 My
 name
 is
 Korg
 Im
 kind
 of
 like
 the
 leader
 in
 here
 Im
 made
 of
 rocks
 as
 you
 can
 see
 But
 dont
 let
 that
 intimidate
 you
 You
 dont
 need
 to
 be
 afraid
 unless
 youre
 made
 of
 scissors
 Just
 a
 little
 rockpaperscissor
 joke
 for
 you
 This
 is
 my
 very
 good
 friend
 over
 here
 Miek
 Hes
 an
 insect
 and
 has
 knives
 for
 hands
 Youre
 a
 Kronan
 arent
 you
 
 That
 I
 am
 
 Howd
 you
 end
 up
 in
 here
 Well
 I
 tried
 to
 start
 a
 revolution
 but
 didnt
 print
 enough
 pamphlets
 So
 hardly
 anyone
 turned
 up
 except
 for
 my
 mum
 and
 her
 boyfriend
 who
 I
 hate
 As
 punishment
 I
 was
 forced
 to
 be
 in
 here
 and
 become
 a
 gladiator
 Bit
 of
 a
 promotional
 disaster
 that
 one
 But
 Im
 actually
 organizing
 another
 revolution
 I
 dont
 know
 if
 youd
 be
 interested
 in
 something
 like
 that
 Do
 you
 reckon
 youd
 be
 interested
 How
 did
 you
 Yeah
 no
 This
 whole
 thing
 is
 a
 circle
 But
 not
 a
 real
 circle
 more
 like
 a
 freaky
 circle
 
 This
 doesnt
 make
 any
 sense
 
 No
 nothing
 makes
 sense
 here
 man
 The
 only
 thing
 that
 does
 make
 sense
 is
 that
 nothing
 makes
 sense
 Has
 anyone
 here
 fought
 the
 Grandmasters
 champion
 Doug
 has
 Doug
 Our
 luck
 Dougs
 dead
 Thats
 right
 Everyone
 who
 fights
 the
 Grandmasters
 champion
 perishes
 What
 about
 you
 Youre
 made
 of
 rocks
 Perishable
 rock
 There
 you
 go
 Another
 one
 gone
 Yeah
 no
 I
 just
 do
 the
 smaller
 fights
 warm
 up
 the
 crowd
 and
 whatnot
 Wait
 Youre
 not
 gonna
 face
 him
 are
 you
 Yes
 I
 am
 Gonna
 fight
 him
 win
 and
 get
 the
 hell
 out
 of
 this
 place
 Thats
 exactly
 what
 Doug
 used
 to
 say
 See
 you
 later
 new
 Doug
 Does
 no
 one
 remember
 me
 Has
 no
 one
 been
 taught
 our
 history
 Look
 at
 these
 lies
 Goblets
 and
 garden
 parties
 Peace
 treaties
 Odin
 Proud
 to
 have
 it
 ashamed
 of
 how
 he
 got
 it
 We
 were
 unstoppable
 I
 was
 his
 weapon
 in
 the
 conquest
 that
 built
 Asgards
 empire
 One
 by
 one
 the
 realms
 became
 ours
 But
 then
 simply
 because
 my
 ambition
 outgrew
 his
 he
 banished
 me
 caged
 me
 locked
 me
 away
 like
 an
 animal
 Before
 that
 Asgards
 warriors
 were
 honored
 their
 bodies
 buried
 as
 heroes
 beneath
 this
 very
 palace
 
 Odins
 treasures
 
 Fake
 Most
 of
 the
 stuff
 in
 here
 is
 fake
 Or
 weak
 Smaller
 than
 I
 thought
 it
 would
 be
 Thats
 not
 bad
 But
 this
 The
 Eternal
 Flame
 Want
 to
 see
 what
 true
 power
 really
 looks
 like
 Fenris
 my
 darling
 what
 have
 they
 done
 to
 you
 With
 the
 Eternal
 Flame
 you
 are
 reborn
 Ive
 missed
 you
 Ive
 missed
 you
 all
 Odin
 I
 bid
 you
 take
 your
 place
 in
 the
 halls
 of
 Valhalla
 where
 the
 brave
 shall
 live
 forever
 Nor
 shall
 we
 mourn
 but
 rejoice
 for
 those
 that
 have
 died
 the
 glorious
 death
 Hurts
 doesnt
 it
 Being
 lied
 to
 Being
 told
 youre
 one
 thing
 and
 then
 learning
 its
 all
 a
 fiction
 You
 didnt
 think
 Id
 really
 come
 and
 see
 you
 did
 you
 This
 place
 is
 disgusting
 Does
 this
 mean
 you
 dont
 want
 my
 help
 Look
 I
 couldnt
 jeopardize
 my
 position
 with
 the
 Grandmaster
 It
 took
 me
 time
 to
 win
 his
 trust
 Hes
 a
 lunatic
 but
 he
 can
 be
 amenable
 What
 Im
 telling
 you
 is
 you
 could
 join
 me
 at
 the
 Grandmasters
 side
 Perhaps
 in
 time
 an
 accident
 befalls
 the
 Grandmaster
 and
 then
 Youre
 not
 seriously
 thinking
 of
 going
 back
 are
 you
 Our
 sister
 destroyed
 your
 hammer
 like
 a
 piece
 of
 glass
 Shes
 stronger
 than
 both
 of
 us
 Shes
 stronger
 than
 you
 You
 dont
 stand
 a
 chance
 Do
 you
 understand
 what
 Im
 saying
 here
 Fine
 I
 guess
 Ill
 just
 have
 to
 go
 it
 alone
 Like
 Ive
 always
 done
 Would
 you
 say
 something
 Say
 something
 What
 would
 you
 like
 me
 to
 say
 You
 faked
 your
 own
 death
 you
 stole
 the
 throne
 stripped
 Odin
 of
 his
 power
 stranded
 him
 on
 Earth
 to
 die
 releasing
 the
 Goddess
 of
 Death
 Have
 I
 said
 enough
 or
 would
 you
 like
 me
 to
 go
 back
 further
 than
 the
 past
 two
 days
 You
 know
 I
 havent
 seen
 this
 beloved
 champion
 he
 talks
 of
 but
 Ive
 heard
 he
 is
 astonishingly
 savage
 Ive
 placed
 a
 large
 wager
 against
 you
 tomorrow
 Dont
 let
 me
 down
 Piss
 off
 ghost
 Hes
 freaking
 gone
 Yuck
 Theres
 still
 someones
 hair
 and
 blood
 all
 over
 this
 Guys
 can
 you
 clean
 up
 the
 weapons
 once
 you
 finish
 your
 fight
 Disgusting
 slobs
 Thor
 wanna
 use
 a
 big
 wooden
 fork
 No
 Yeah
 not
 really
 useful
 Unless
 youre
 fighting
 off
 three
 vampires
 that
 were
 huddled
 together
 I
 really
 wish
 I
 had
 my
 hammer
 Hammer
 Quite
 unique
 It
 was
 made
 from
 this
 special
 metal
 from
 the
 heart
 of
 a
 dying
 star
 And
 when
 I
 spun
 it
 really
 really
 fast
 it
 gave
 me
 the
 ability
 to
 fly
 You
 rode
 a
 hammer
 No
 I
 didnt
 ride
 the
 hammer
 The
 hammer
 rode
 you
 on
 your
 back
 No
 I
 used
 to
 spin
 it
 really
 fast
 and
 it
 would
 pull
 me
 off
 the
 Oh
 my
 God
 A
 hammer
 pulled
 you
 off
 The
 ground
 It
 would
 pull
 me
 off
 the
 ground
 up
 into
 the
 air
 and
 I
 would
 fly
 Every
 time
 I
 threw
 it
 it
 would
 always
 come
 back
 to
 me
 Sounds
 like
 you
 had
 a
 pretty
 special
 and
 intimate
 relationship
 with
 this
 hammer
 and
 that
 losing
 it
 was
 almost
 comparable
 to
 losing
 a
 loved
 one
 Thats
 a
 nice
 way
 of
 putting
 it
 I
 said
 theyre
 mine
 See
 her
 thats
 the
 one
 that
 put
 me
 in
 here
 Yeah
 Scrapper
 
 Gotta
 watch
 out
 for
 those
 Asgardians
 man
 They
 are
 hard
 to
 perish
 Asgardian
 Hey
 Hey
 Hey
 Do
 not
 zap
 me
 with
 that
 thing
 I
 just
 wanna
 talk
 Asgard
 is
 in
 danger
 My
 God
 youre
 a
 Valkyrie
 I
 used
 to
 wanna
 be
 a
 Valkyrie
 when
 I
 was
 younger
 until
 I
 found
 out
 that
 you
 were
 all
 women
 Theres
 nothing
 wrong
 with
 women
 of
 course
 I
 love
 women
 Sometimes
 a
 little
 too
 much
 Not
 in
 a
 creepy
 way
 just
 more
 of
 a
 respectful
 appreciation
 I
 think
 its
 great
 that
 there
 is
 an
 elite
 force
 of
 women
 warriors
 Its
 about
 time
 Are
 you
 done
 Lord
 of
 Thunder
 youre
 up
 Please
 help
 me
 I
 need
 your
 help
 Bye
 Fine
 then
 you
 must
 be
 a
 traitor
 or
 a
 coward
 Because
 the
 Valkyrie
 is
 sworn
 to
 protect
 the
 throne
 Listen
 closely
 your
 majesty
 This
 is
 Sakaar
 not
 Asgard
 And
 Im
 a
 Scrapper
 not
 a
 Valkyrie
 Bring
 him
 in
 for
 processing
 And
 no
 one
 escapes
 this
 place
 So
 youre
 gonna
 die
 anyway
 Now
 dont
 you
 move
 My
 hands
 aint
 as
 steady
 as
 they
 used
 to
 be
 By
 Odins
 beard
 you
 shall
 not
 cut
 my
 hair
 lest
 you
 feel
 the
 wrath
 of
 the
 mighty
 Thor
 Please
 Please
 kind

 not
 cut
 my
 hair

 Asgard
 sworn
 to
 defend
 the
 throne
 Im
 not
 getting
 dragged
 into
 another
 one
 of
 Odins
 family
 squabbles
 
 Whats
 that
 supposed
 to
 mean
 
 Your
 sister
 Her
 power
 comes
 from
 Asgard
 same
 as
 yours
 When
 it
 grew
 beyond
 Odins
 control
 she
 massacred
 everyone
 in
 the
 palace
 and
 tried
 to
 seize
 the
 throne
 When
 she
 tried
 to
 escape
 her
 banishment
 he
 sent
 the
 Valkyrie
 in
 to
 fight
 her
 back
 I
 only
 survived
 because
 Look
 I
 already
 faced
 her
 once
 back
 when
 I
 believed
 in
 the
 throne
 and
 it
 cost
 me
 everything
 Thats
 whats
 wrong
 with
 Asgard
 The
 throne
 the
 secrets
 the
 whole
 golden
 sham
 I
 agree
 Dont
 get
 familiar
 I
 agree
 Thats
 why
 I
 turned
 down
 the
 throne
 But
 this
 isnt
 about
 the
 crown
 This
 is
 about
 the
 people
 Theyre
 dying
 and
 theyre
 your
 people
 too
 Forget
 it
 I
 have
 
 Okay
 
 Okay

 that
 lunatic
 Keep
 drinking
 keep
 hiding
 But

 I
 choose
 to
 run
 toward
 my
 problems
 and
 not
 away
 from
 them
 Because
 thats
 what
 Because
 thats
 what

 a
 fight
 recently
 
 Did
 I

 No
 I

 Easily
 Doesnt

 Well

 true
 It
 seems
 that
 that
 criminally
 seductive
 Lord
 of
 Thunder
 has
 stolen
 him
 away
 Seductive
 God
 of
 Thunder
 We
 need
 to
 move
 Oh

 The

 The
 suns

 really
 low
 Suns
 going
 down
 Im
 upset
 Im
 very
 upset
 You
 know
 what
 I
 like
 about
 being
 upset
 The
 blame
 Right
 now
 thats
 the
 mindset
 that
 Im
 in
 And
 you
 know
 who
 Im
 blaming
 
 Grandmaster
 I
 can
 
 Hey
 Dont
 interrupt
 me
 Here
 you
 go
 Why
 are
 you
 handing
 me
 the
 melt
 stick
 He
 was
 interrupting
 Thats
 not
 a
 capital
 violation
 Where
 was
 I
 My
 precious
 champion
 has
 come
 up
 missing
 and
 its
 all
 because
 of
 that
 Lord
 of
 Thunder
 Its
 all
 because
 of
 him
 Your
 brother
 Whatever
 the
 story
 is
 Adopted
 or
 complicated
 or
 you
 know
 Im
 sure
 theres
 a
 big
 history
 And
 your
 contender
 My
 dear
 friend
 if
 you
 were
 to
 give
 me
 
 hours
 I
 could
 bring
 them
 both
 back
 to
 you
 Alive
 I
 could
 do
 it
 in
 two
 I
 could
 do
 it
 in
 one
 Lets
 stop
 there
 You
 know
 what
 I
 woke
 up
 this
 morning
 thinking
 about
 a
 public
 execution
 But
 for
 now
 Ill
 settle
 for
 this
 sweet
 little
 Whos
 gonna
 get
 him
 first
 So
 youre
 on
 the
 clock
 What
 have
 you
 done
 I
 dont
 answer
 to
 you
 lackey
 Its
 Loki
 And
 you
 will
 answer
 to
 the
 Grandmaster
 Why
 would
 you
 help
 my
 brother
 escape
 with
 that
 green
 fool
 I
 dont
 help
 anyone
 Youre
 a
 Valkyrie
 I
 thought
 the
 Valkyrie
 had
 all
 died
 gruesome
 deaths
 Choose
 your
 next
 words
 wisely
 Im
 terribly
 sorry
 Must
 be
 a
 very
 painful
 memory
 The
 suns
 going
 down
 Its
 getting
 really
 low
 The
 suns
 going
 down
 Its
 getting
 real
 low
 Oh
 shoot
 
 Suns
 getting
 low
 
 Would
 you
 stop
 saying
 that
 I
 just
 need
 you
 to
 stay
 calm
 Calm
 Im
 on
 an
 alien
 planet
 Its
 just
 a
 planet
 Youve
 been
 on
 a
 planet
 before
 Yeah
 One
 Now
 youve
 been
 on
 two
 Thats
 a
 good
 thing
 Its
 a
 new
 experience
 My
 neurons
 theyre
 firing
 faster
 than
 my
 brain
 can
 handle
 the
 information
 The
 whole
 thing
 is
 totally
 different
 this
 time
 In
 the
 past
 I
 always
 felt
 like
 Hulk
 and
 I
 each
 had
 a
 hand
 on
 the
 wheel
 But
 this
 time
 its
 like
 he
 had
 the
 keys
 to
 the
 car
 and
 I
 was
 locked
 in
 the
 trunk
 All
 right
 well
 youre
 back
 now
 Thats
 all
 that
 matters
 No
 its
 not
 what
 matters
 What
 Im
 trying
 to
 tell
 you
 is
 that
 if
 I
 turn
 into
 the
 Hulk
 again
 Banner
 may
 never
 come
 back
 And
 were
 stranded
 on
 a
 planet
 that
 is
 designed
 to
 stress
 me
 out
 Were
 not
 stranded
 Im
 gonna
 figure
 out
 a
 way
 to
 get
 us
 home
 Thank
 you
 Not
 your
 home
 though
 Asgard
 My
 home
 What
 Listen
 my
 people
 are
 in
 great
 danger
 You
 and
 I
 we
 have
 to
 fight
 this
 really
 powerful
 being
 who
 also
 happens
 to
 be
 my
 sister
 Okay
 that
 is
 so
 wrong
 on
 so
 many
 I
 dont
 wanna
 fight
 your
 sister
 Thats
 a
 family
 issue
 No
 shes
 an
 evil
 being
 I
 dont
 care
 what
 she
 is
 Im
 not
 fighting
 any
 more
 beings
 Im
 sick
 of
 it
 
 What
 
 I
 just
 told
 you
 If
 I
 turn
 into
 the
 Hulk
 I
 am
 never
 gonna
 come
 back
 again
 And
 you
 dont
 care
 No
 no
 Im
 putting
 together
 the
 team
 The
 Hulk
 is
 the
 fire
 Wait
 youre
 just
 using
 me
 to
 get
 to
 the
 Hulk
 
 What
 No
 
 Its
 gross
 You
 dont
 care
 about
 me
 Youre
 not
 my
 friend
 No
 I
 dont
 even
 like
 the
 Hulk
 Hes
 all
 like
 Smash
 smash
 smash
 I
 prefer
 you
 Thanks
 But
 if
 Im
 being
 honest
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 fighting
 evil
 beings
 he
 is
 very
 powerful
 and
 useful
 Yeah
 Banners
 powerful
 and
 useful
 too
 Is
 he
 though
 How
 many
 PhDs
 does
 Hulk
 have
 Zero
 How
 many
 PhDs
 does
 Banner
 have
 Seven
 Fine
 you
 dont
 have
 to
 fight
 anyone
 But
 were
 in
 danger
 here
 so
 we
 have
 to
 move
 What
 are
 you
 doing
 with
 that
 I
 need
 a
 disguise
 Im
 a
 fugitive
 
 I
 need
 a
 disguise
 
 You
 are
 the
 disguise
 
 Ill
 be
 Tony
 Stark
 
 What
 Yeah
 Tony
 and
 the
 gypsy
 No
 no
 youre
 not
 Tony
 Youre
 Bruce
 Bruce
 Banner
 Then
 why
 did
 you
 dress
 me
 up
 like
 Tony
 Because
 you
 were
 naked
 Okay
 Ill
 give
 you
 that
 What
 are
 you
 doing
 Stop
 doing
 that
 Tony
 wears
 his
 pants
 super
 tight
 
 Stop
 it
 
 Im
 sorry
 
 Why
 are
 you
 being
 so
 weird
 
 I
 dont
 know
 Maybe
 the
 fact
 that
 I
 was
 trapped
 for
 two
 years
 inside
 of
 a
 monster
 made
 me
 a
 little
 weird
 Hey
 Its
 okay
 Youre
 good
 Calm
 down
 Come
 on
 Listen
 were
 gonna
 go
 to
 Asgard
 and
 youre
 not
 gonna
 have
 to
 think
 about
 the
 Hulk
 ever
 again
 All
 right
 All
 right
 This
 is
 bad
 Banner
 Banner
 Banner
 Banner
 Thor
 Hi
 Hi
 I
 was
 gonna
 do
 that
 Yeah
 well
 I
 did
 it
 first
 Thats
 good
 What
 are
 you
 doing
 here
 What
 are
 you
 doing
 here
 I
 thought
 you
 were
 leaving
 I
 got
 sidetracked
 Whats
 with
 the
 Its
 my
 disguise
 But
 I
 can
 see
 your
 face
 Not
 when
 I
 do
 this
 you
 cant
 Your
 hair
 looks
 nice
 I
 like
 what
 you
 did
 with
 it
 Change
 it
 Washed
 it
 maybe
 What
 are
 those
 things
 on
 her
 eyes
 Are
 those
 people
 that
 shes
 killed
 Shes
 so
 beautiful
 and
 strong
 and
 courageous
 Who
 is
 this
 guy
 
 Hes
 a
 friend
 
 Who
 Me
 
 Im
 Bruce
 
 I
 feel
 like
 I
 know
 you
 I
 feel
 like
 I
 know
 you
 too
 Look
 Ive
 spent
 years
 in
 a
 haze
 trying
 to
 forget
 my
 past
 Sakaar
 seemed
 like
 the
 best
 place
 to
 drink
 and
 forget
 and
 to
 die
 one
 day
 I
 was
 thinking
 that
 you
 drink
 too
 much
 and
 that
 probably
 was
 gonna
 kill
 you
 I
 dont
 plan
 to
 stop
 drinking
 But
 I
 dont
 wanna
 forget
 I
 cant
 turn
 away
 anymore
 so
 if
 Im
 gonna
 die
 well
 it
 may
 as
 well
 be
 driving
 my
 sword
 through
 the
 heart
 of
 that
 murderous
 hag
 
 Good
 
 Yeah
 So
 Im
 saying
 that
 I
 wanna
 be
 on
 the
 team
 Has
 it
 got
 a
 name
 Yeah
 its
 called
 the
 Revengers
 Revengers
 Because
 Im
 getting
 revenge
 Youre
 getting
 revenge
 Do
 you
 want
 revenge
 Im
 undecided
 Okay
 Also
 Ive
 got
 a
 peace
 offering
 Surprise
 Just
 had
 to
 be
 sure
 Hello
 Bruce
 So
 last
 time
 I
 saw
 you
 you
 were
 trying
 to
 kill
 everybody
 Where
 are
 you
 at
 these
 days
 It
 varies
 from
 moment
 to
 moment
 Is
 that
 a
 Dragonfang
 It
 is
 My
 God
 This
 is
 the
 famed
 sword
 of
 the
 Valkyrie
 So
 Sakaar
 and
 Asgard
 are
 about
 as
 far
 apart
 as
 any
 two
 known
 systems
 Our
 best
 bet
 is
 a
 wormhole
 just
 outside
 of
 city
 limits
 Refuel
 on
 Xandar
 and
 we
 can
 be
 back
 in
 Asgard
 in
 
 months
 Nope
 We
 are
 going
 through
 the
 big
 one
 The
 Devils
 Anus
 Anus
 Wait
 wait
 wait
 Whose
 anus
 For
 the
 record
 I
 didnt
 know
 it
 was
 called
 that
 when
 I
 picked
 it
 That
 looks
 like
 a
 collapsing
 neutron
 star
 inside
 of
 an
 EinsteinRosen
 Bridge
 We
 need
 another
 ship
 That
 will
 tear
 mine
 to
 pieces
 Shes
 right
 We
 need
 one
 that
 can
 withstand
 the
 geodetic
 strain
 from
 the
 singularity
 And
 has
 an
 offline
 power
 steering
 system
 that
 could
 also
 function
 without
 the
 onboard
 computer
 And
 we
 need
 one
 with
 cup
 holders
 because
 were
 gonna
 die
 So
 drinks
 Do
 I
 know
 you
 I
 feel
 like
 I
 know
 you
 I
 feel
 like
 I
 know
 you
 too
 Its
 weird
 What
 do
 you
 say
 Uncharted
 metagalactic
 travel
 through
 a
 volatile
 cosmic
 gateway
 Talk
 about
 an
 adventure
 
 We
 need
 a
 ship
 
 Need
 a
 ship
 There
 are
 one
 or
 two
 ships
 Absolute
 top
 of
 the
 line
 models
 I
 dont
 mean
 to
 impose
 But
 the
 Grandmaster
 has
 a
 great
 many
 ships
 I
 may
 even
 have
 stolen
 the
 access
 codes
 to
 his
 security
 system
 And
 suddenly
 youre
 overcome
 with
 an
 urge
 to
 do
 the
 right
 thing
 Heavens
 no
 Ive
 run
 out
 of
 favor
 with
 the
 Grandmaster
 and
 in
 exchange
 for
 codes
 and
 access
 to
 a
 ship
 Im
 asking
 for
 safe
 passage
 through
 the
 Anus
 Youre
 telling
 us
 that
 you
 can
 get
 us
 access
 into
 the
 garage
 without
 setting
 off
 any
 alarms
 Yes
 brother
 I
 can
 Okay
 can
 I
 just
 A
 quick
 FYI
 I
 was
 just
 talking
 to
 him
 just
 a
 couple
 minutes
 ago
 and
 he
 was
 totally
 ready
 to
 kill
 any
 of
 us
 He
 did
 try
 to
 kill
 me
 Yes
 me
 too
 On
 many
 many
 occasions
 There
 was
 one
 time
 when
 we
 were
 children
 he
 transformed
 himself
 into
 a
 snake
 and
 he
 knows
 that
 I
 love
 snakes
 So
 I
 went
 to
 pick
 up
 the
 snake
 to
 admire
 it
 and
 he
 transformed
 back
 into
 himself
 and
 he
 was
 like
 Yeah
 its
 me
 And
 he
 stabbed
 me
 We
 were
 eight
 at
 the
 time
 If
 were
 boosting
 a
 ship
 were
 gonna
 need
 to
 draw
 some
 guards
 away
 from
 the
 palace
 Why
 not
 set
 the
 beast
 loose
 Shut
 up
 You
 guys
 have
 a
 beast
 No
 theres
 no
 beast
 Hes
 just
 being
 stupid
 Were
 going
 to
 start
 a
 revolution
 
 Revolution
 
 Ill
 explain
 later
 
 Whos
 this
 guy
 again
 
 Ill
 explain
 later
 Is
 that
 some
 sort
 of
 protoplasm
 all
 the
 stuff
 thats
 coming
 out
 of
 you
 or
 are
 they
 eggs
 Looks
 like
 eggs
 Im
 looking
 for
 Korg
 Whos
 asking
 I
 know
 youre
 asking
 Is
 there
 anyone
 else
 asking
 or
 is
 it
 just
 you
 The
 Lord
 of
 Thunder
 sends
 his
 best
 The
 revolution
 has
 begun
 Revolution
 How
 did
 this
 happen
 Dont
 know
 But
 the
 arenas
 mainframe
 for
 the
 Obedience
 Disks
 have
 been
 deactivated
 and
 the
 slaves
 have
 armed
 themselves
 I
 dont
 like
 that
 word
 Which
 Mainframe
 No
 Why
 would
 I
 not
 like
 mainframe
 No
 the
 S
 word
 Sorry
 the
 prisoners
 with
 jobs
 have
 armed
 themselves
 Okay
 thats
 better
 Hey
 so
 listen
 We
 should
 talk
 I
 disagree
 Open
 communication
 was
 never
 our
 familys
 forte
 You
 have
 no
 idea
 Been
 quite
 the
 revelation
 since
 we
 last
 spoke
 Hello
 Hi
 Odin
 brought
 us
 together
 Its
 almost
 poetic
 that
 his
 death
 should
 split
 us
 apart
 We
 might
 as
 well
 be
 strangers
 now
 Two
 sons
 of
 the
 crown
 set
 adrift
 Thought
 you
 didnt
 wanna
 talk
 about
 it
 Heres
 the
 thing
 Im
 probably
 better
 off
 staying
 here
 on
 Sakaar
 Thats
 exactly
 what
 I
 was
 thinking
 Did
 you
 just
 agree
 with
 me
 Come
 on
 this
 place
 is
 perfect
 for
 you
 Its
 savage
 chaotic
 lawless
 Brother
 youre
 gonna
 do
 great
 here
 Do
 you
 truly
 think
 so
 little
 of
 me
 Loki
 I
 thought
 the
 world
 of
 you
 I
 thought
 we
 were
 gonna
 fight
 side
 by
 side
 forever
 But
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day
 youre
 you
 and
 Im
 me
 I
 dont
 know
 maybe
 theres
 still
 good
 in
 you
 But
 lets
 be
 honest
 our
 paths
 diverged
 a
 long
 time
 ago
 Yeah
 Its
 probably
 for
 the
 best
 that
 we
 never
 see
 each
 other
 again
 Its
 what
 you
 always
 wanted
 Hey
 lets
 do
 Get
 Help
 
 What
 
 Get
 Help
 No
 
 Come
 on
 you
 love
 it
 
 I
 hate
 it
 
 Its
 great
 It
 works
 every
 time
 
 Its
 humiliating
 
 Do
 you
 have
 a
 better
 plan
 
 No
 Were
 doing
 it
 We
 are
 not
 doing
 Get
 Help
 Get
 help
 Please
 My
 brother
 hes
 dying
 Get
 help
 Help
 him
 Classic
 Still
 hate
 it
 
 Its
 humiliating
 
 Not
 for
 me
 its
 not
 Now
 which
 ones
 the
 ship
 she
 told
 us
 to
 get
 The
 Commodore
 Right
 Though
 I
 feel
 it
 wont
 make
 much
 of
 a
 difference
 Loki
 I
 know
 Ive
 betrayed
 you
 many
 times
 before
 but
 this
 time
 its
 truly
 nothing
 personal
 The
 reward
 for
 your
 capture
 will
 set
 me
 up
 nicely
 Never
 one
 for
 sentiment
 were
 you
 Easier
 to
 let
 it
 burn
 I
 agree
 That
 looks
 painful
 Dear
 brother
 youre
 becoming
 predictable
 I
 trust
 you
 you
 betray
 me
 Round
 and
 round
 in
 circles
 we
 go
 See
 Loki
 life
 is
 about
 Its
 about
 growth
 Its
 about
 change
 But
 you
 seem
 to
 just
 wanna
 stay
 the
 same
 I
 guess
 what
 Im
 trying
 to
 say
 is
 that
 youll
 always
 be
 the
 God
 of
 Mischief
 but
 you
 could
 be
 more
 Ill
 just
 put
 this
 over
 here
 for
 you
 Anyway
 all
 got
 places
 to
 be
 so
 good
 luck
 All
 right
 I
 can
 figure
 this
 out
 Its
 just
 another
 spaceship
 Loyal
 Sakaarians
 Lord
 of
 Thunder
 has
 stolen
 my
 ship
 and
 my
 favorite
 champion
 Sakaarians
 take
 to
 the
 skies
 Bring
 him
 down
 Do
 not
 let
 him
 leave
 this
 planet
 
 Good
 shot
 
 Thanks
 Open
 the
 doors
 Okay
 I
 hope
 that
 youre
 tougher
 than
 you
 look
 Why
 Shouldnt
 we
 be
 shooting
 back
 or
 something
 Yes
 we
 should
 Where
 are
 the
 guns
 on
 this
 ship
 There
 arent
 any
 
 Its
 a
 leisure
 vessel
 
 What
 Grandmaster
 uses
 it
 for
 his
 good
 times
 orgies
 and
 stuff
 Did
 she
 just
 say
 the
 Grandmaster
 uses
 it
 for
 orgies
 Yeah
 Dont
 touch
 anything
 No
 
 No
 
 No
 Get
 inside
 In
 a
 minute
 I
 should
 probably
 go
 and
 help
 Here
 take
 the
 wheel
 No
 I
 dont
 know
 how
 to
 fly
 one
 of
 these
 Youre
 a
 scientist

 of
 your
 PhDs

 flying
 alien
 spaceships

 gun
 Its

 the
 Devils

 Our

 Thank

 Hey

 Were
 about
 to
 jump
 on
 that
 ginormous
 spaceship
 You
 wanna
 come
 You
 do
 seem
 like
 youre
 in
 desperate
 need
 of
 leadership
 Why
 thank
 you
 Here

 Shit
 Asgardians
 Some
 misguided
 soul
 has
 stolen
 the
 Bifrost
 sword
 Tell
 us
 where
 it
 is
 or
 there
 will
 be
 consequences
 Bad
 ones
 Well
 You
 Well
 Executioner
 Wait
 Wait
 I
 know
 where
 the
 sword
 is
 I
 never
 thought
 Id
 be
 back
 here
 I
 thought
 itd
 be
 a
 lot
 nicer
 I
 mean
 not
 that
 its
 not
 nice
 Its
 just
 its
 on
 fire
 Here
 up
 here
 in
 the
 mountains
 Heat
 signatures
 People
 clustered
 together
 Shes
 coming
 for
 them
 Okay
 drop
 me
 off
 at
 the
 palace
 and
 Ill
 draw
 her
 away
 And
 get
 yourself
 killed
 The
 people
 trapped
 down
 there
 are
 all
 that
 matters
 While
 Im
 dealing
 with
 Hela
 I
 need
 you
 two
 to
 help
 get
 everyone
 off
 Asgard
 How
 the
 hell
 are
 we
 supposed
 to
 do
 that
 I
 have
 a
 man
 on
 the
 ground
 Asgard
 Shes
 here
 Now
 the
 ship
 has
 a
 gun
 Ill
 take
 it
 from
 here
 I
 found
 this
 in
 the
 armory
 Good
 luck
 Your
 Majesty
 Dont
 die
 You
 know
 what
 I
 mean
 We
 must
 keep
 moving
 Go
 to
 the
 Bifrost
 Sister
 Youre
 still
 alive
 I
 love
 what
 youve
 done
 with
 the
 place
 Redecorating
 I
 see
 It
 seems
 our
 fathers
 solution
 to
 every
 problem
 was
 to
 cover
 it
 up
 Or
 to
 cast
 it
 out
 He
 told
 you
 you
 were
 worthy
 He
 said
 the
 same
 thing
 to
 me
 You
 see
 You
 never
 knew
 him
 Not
 at
 his
 best
 Odin
 and
 I
 drowned
 entire
 civilizations
 in
 blood
 and
 tears
 Where
 do
 you
 think
 all
 this
 gold
 came
 from
 And
 then
 one
 day
 he
 decided
 to
 become
 a
 benevolent
 king
 To
 foster
 peace
 to
 protect
 life
 To
 have
 you
 I
 understand
 why
 youre
 angry
 And
 you
 are
 my
 sister
 and
 technically
 have
 a
 claim
 to
 the
 throne
 And
 believe
 me
 I
 would
 love
 for
 someone
 else
 to
 rule
 But
 it
 cant
 be
 you
 Youre
 just
 the
 worst
 Okay
 get
 up
 Youre
 in
 my
 seat
 You
 know
 Father
 once
 told
 me
 that
 a
 wise
 king
 never
 seeks
 out
 war
 But
 must
 always
 be
 ready
 for
 it
 Go
 back
 Go
 To
 be
 honest
 I
 expected
 more
 Heimdall
 The
 sword
 Heres
 the
 difference
 between
 us
 Im
 Odins
 firstborn
 the
 rightful
 heir
 the
 savior
 of
 Asgard
 And
 youre
 nothing
 So
 simple
 even
 a
 blind
 man
 could
 see
 it
 Now
 you
 remind
 me
 of
 Dad
 The
 stupid
 dog
 wont
 die
 Everythings
 gonna
 be
 all
 right
 now
 I
 got
 this
 You
 wanted
 to
 know
 who
 I
 am
 What
 the
 hell
 are
 you
 talking
 about
 Youll
 see
 You
 see
 No
 ones
 going
 anywhere
 Ill
 get
 that
 sword
 even
 if
 I
 have
 to
 kill
 every
 single
 one
 of
 them
 to
 do
 it
 Hey
 man
 Im
 Korg
 This
 is
 Miek
 Were
 gonna
 jump
 on
 that
 spaceship
 and
 get
 out
 of
 here
 Wanna
 come
 Your
 savior
 is
 here
 Did
 you
 miss
 me
 Everyone
 on
 that
 ship
 now
 Welcome
 home
 I
 saw
 you
 coming
 Of
 course
 you
 did
 Its
 a
 valiant
 effort
 but
 you
 never
 stood
 a
 chance
 You
 see
 Im
 not
 a
 queen
 or
 a
 monster
 Im
 the
 Goddess
 of
 Death
 What
 were
 you
 the
 god
 of
 again
 Even
 when
 you
 had
 two
 eyes
 youd
 see
 only
 half
 the
 picture
 Shes
 too
 strong
 Without
 my
 hammer
 I
 cant
 Are
 you
 Thor
 the
 God
 of
 Hammers
 That
 hammer
 was
 to
 help
 you
 control
 your
 power
 to
 focus
 it
 It
 was
 never
 your
 source
 of
 strength
 Its
 too
 late
 Shes
 already
 taken
 Asgard
 Asgard
 is
 not
 a
 place
 Never
 was
 This
 could
 be
 Asgard
 Asgard
 is
 where
 our
 people
 stand
 Even
 now
 right
 now
 those
 people
 need
 your
 help
 Im
 not
 as
 strong
 as
 you
 No
 Youre
 stronger
 Tell
 me
 brother
 What
 were
 you
 the
 god
 of
 again
 
 Youre
 late
 
 Youre
 missing
 an
 eye
 This
 isnt
 over
 I
 think
 we
 should
 disband
 the
 Revengers
 Hit
 her
 with
 a
 lightning
 blast
 I
 just
 hit
 her
 with
 the
 biggest
 lightning
 blast
 in
 the
 history
 of
 lightning
 It
 did
 nothing
 We
 just
 need
 to
 hold
 her
 off
 until
 everyones
 on
 board
 It
 wont
 end
 there
 The
 longer
 Helas
 on
 Asgard
 the
 more
 powerful
 she
 grows
 Shell
 hunt
 us
 down
 We
 need
 to
 stop
 her
 here
 and
 now
 So
 what
 do
 we
 do
 Im
 not
 doing
 Get
 Help
 Asgards
 not
 a
 place
 its
 a
 people
 Loki
 this
 was
 never
 about
 stopping
 Ragnarok
 This
 was
 about
 causing
 Ragnarok
 Surturs
 crown
 the
 vault
 Its
 the
 only
 way
 Bold
 move
 brother
 Even
 for
 me
 Shall
 we
 After
 you
 This
 is
 madness
 Go
 Go
 now
 For
 Asgard
 Hela
 With
 the
 Eternal
 Flame
 you
 are
 reborn
 Hela
 enough
 You
 want
 Asgard
 its
 yours
 Whatever
 game
 youre
 playing
 it
 wont
 work
 You
 cant
 defeat
 me
 No
 I
 know
 But
 he
 can
 No
 Tremble
 before
 me
 Asgard
 I
 am
 your
 reckoning
 The
 people
 are
 safe
 Thats
 all
 that
 matters
 Were
 fulfilling
 the
 prophecy
 I
 hate
 this
 prophecy
 So
 do
 I
 but
 we
 have
 no
 choice
 Surtur
 destroys
 Asgard
 he
 destroys
 Hela
 so
 that
 our
 people
 may
 live
 But
 we
 need
 to
 let
 him
 finish
 the
 job
 otherwise
 No
 Hulk
 stop
 you
 moron
 Hulk
 stop
 Just
 for
 once
 in
 your
 life
 dont
 smash
 Big
 monster
 Lets
 go
 Fine
 I
 am
 Asgards
 doom
 The
 damage
 is
 not
 too
 bad
 As
 long
 as
 the
 foundations
 are
 still
 strong
 we
 can
 rebuild
 this
 place
 It
 will
 become
 a
 haven
 for
 all
 peoples
 and
 aliens
 of
 the
 universe
 Now
 those
 foundations
 are
 gone
 Sorry
 What
 have
 I
 done
 You
 saved
 us
 from
 extinction
 Asgard
 is
 not
 a
 place
 Its
 a
 people
 It
 suits
 you
 Maybe
 youre
 not
 so
 bad
 after
 all
 brother
 Maybe
 not
 Thank
 you
 If
 you
 were
 here
 I
 might
 even
 give
 you
 a
 hug
 Im
 here
 Your
 throne
 So
 King
 of
 Asgard
 Where
 to
 Im
 not
 sure
 Any
 suggestions
 Miek
 where
 are
 you
 from
 Mieks
 dead
 Yeah
 no
 I
 accidentally
 stomped
 on
 him
 on
 the
 bridge
 Ive
 just
 felt
 so
 guilty
 Ive
 been
 carrying
 him
 around
 all
 day
 Miek
 youre
 alive
 Hes
 alive
 guys
 What
 was
 your
 question
 again
 bro
 Earth
 it
 is
 Do
 you
 really
 think
 its
 a
 good
 idea
 to
 go
 back
 to
 Earth
 Yes
 of
 course
 The
 people
 of
 Earth
 love
 me
 Im
 very
 popular
 Let
 me
 rephrase
 that
 Do
 you
 really
 think
 its
 a
 good
 idea
 to
 bring
 me
 back
 to
 Earth
 Probably
 not
 to
 be
 honest
 I
 wouldnt
 worry
 brother
 I
 feel
 like
 everythings
 gonna
 work
 out
 fine
 Oh

 I
 just
 gotta
 say
 Im
 proud
 of
 you

 This
 revolution

 been
 a
 huge
 success

 back
 Pat

 Cant

 revolution

 somebody
 to
 overthrow
 So

 welcome
 And
 its
 a
 tie
